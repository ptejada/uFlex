[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ptejada/uflex.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/ptejada/uflex)
uFlex 1.0.x
=========================

A simple all-in-one PHP user Authentication library.
This library is developed, maintained and tested in a **PHP 5.3.x** environment. The UnitTest also runs
on Travis-CI for **PHP 5.4.x** and **PHP 5.5.x**.

The single class file `class.uFlex.php` code can be found on the [Legacy Branch](https://github.com/ptejada/uFlex/tree/legacy)

* Try the demo in this package and review its source
* See the methods documentation here <http://ptejada.com/projects/uFlex/documentation/>
* For more detailed documentation check generated PHPDoc <http://ptejada.com/docs/uFlex/namespaces/ptejada.uFlex.html>

Upgrading from 0.9x versions...
====================================

Before updating you will need to run a SQL upgrade script. Make sure you backup your database before running
the upgrade script. Refer to the DB directory <https://github.com/ptejada/uFlex/tree/master/db>

If not using Composer instead of including a PHP class you will include the `autoload.php` script in
your application which will auto include the library classes as required.

If using composer then just include the `vendor/autoload.php` in your application if it has not already
been included.

Overall version 1.0 takes a more object oriented approach and follows conventions more closely.

Getting Started
=========================

* [Including it in your project](#including-it-in-your-project)
* [Configuring the User object](#configuring-the-user-object)
* [Understanding Collections](#understanding-collections)
* [Using the Session](#using-the-session)
* [Extending the User class](#extending-the-user-class)

## Including it in your project

If using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) just add `ptejada/uflex` as a dependency. Note the casing on `uflex`,
all lowercase. Ex:

```
{
    "require": {
        "ptejada/uflex": "1.*"
    }
}
```

When using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) use the `vendor/autoload.php` script to include the library in your
project.

If not using Composer then clone this repository in your project. Use the `autoload.php` script to include the library
in your project.

## Configuring the User object

When the `User` class is instantiated not much happens, the session is not initialized nor a DB connection is established.
This is to allow the class to be configured. Once the configured the `start()` method must be call in order for the user
authentication process
to start. For Example:

```php
<?php
    include('/path/to/uflex/directory/autoload.php');

    //Instantiate the User object
    $user = new ptejada\uFlex\User();

    //Add database credentials
    $user->config->database->host = 'localhost';
    $user->config->database->user = 'test';
    $user->config->database->password = 'test';
    $user->config->database->name = 'uflex_test'; //Database name

    /*
     * You can update any customizable property of the class before starting the object
     * construction process
     */

    //Start object construction
    $user->start();
?>
```
It is preferable that a configuration file like the one above is created per project. This way you can use the configuration
file to provide a pre-configured User instance to any PHP script in your project.

Alternatively you could create your own class which configures and start the the `User` object for you. Ex:

```php
<?php
    
    class MyUser extends ptejada\uFlex\User {
        public function __construct()
        {
            parent::__construct();
            
            //Add database credentials
            $this->config->database->host = 'localhost';
            $this->config->database->user = 'test';
            $this->config->database->password = 'test';
            $this->config->database->name = 'uflex_test'; //Database name

            // Start object construction
            $this->start();
        }
    }
?>
```

Below is an excerpt from the PHP class file which lists the customizable `config` properties you could change prior to calling
`start()` on a `User` instance. Note: the `config` property is a `Collection` instance:

```php
	'cookieTime'      => '30',
    'cookieName'      => 'auto',
    'cookiePath'      => '/',
    'cookieHost'      => false,
    'userTableName'   => 'users',
    'userSession'     => 'userData',
    'userDefaultData' => array(
        'Username' => 'Guess',
        'ID'  => 0,
        'Password' => 0,
    ),
    'database' => array(
        'host'     => 'localhost',
        'name'     => '',
        'user'     => '',
        'password' => '',
        'dsn'      => '',
    )
```

## Understanding Collections

A `Collection` is an object representation of an array. `Collection`s have many uses throughout this project and are
easy to use. What a `Collection` does for us is handle the errors for undefined indexes and streamline our code.

Consider this example working with plain arrays:

```php
<?php
    $data = array(
        'name' => 'pablo',
    );

    if (isset($data['quote']) && $data['quote'])
    {
        echo $data['name'] . "'s quote is: " . $data['quote'];
    }
    else
    {
        echo $data['name'] . " has no quote";
    }
?>
```

Here is the same code using a `Collection`:

```php
<?php
    $data = ptejada\uFlex\Collection(array(
        'name' => 'pablo',
    ));

    if ($data->quote)
    {
        echo  "{$data->name}'s quote is:  $data->quote";
    }
    else
    {
        echo "{$data->name} has no quote";
    }
?>
```

For more information check the [API Documentation][Collection] for the `Collection` class.

## Using the Session

The `User` object provides easy management of the PHP session through its `session` property which is an instance of
the `Session` class. By default the `User` class manages the `userData` namespace in PHP super global $_SESSION but this
is configurable by setting `config->userSession` before the `User` object is started. This is very powerful since it lets
the `User` class use the PHP session without interfering with other software the their session usage.

The `Session` class is just an extended `Collection` so it works like any other collection. The only difference is a few
additional methods and the fact that it is a linked collection meaning that any changes made in the object will be
reflected on `$_SESSION` and thus automatically saved on the PHP session.

Consider the following code and its output to give you a better idea of how everything works together:

```php
<?php

    $user = new ptejada\uFlex\User();

    // Change the session namespace
    $user->config->userSession = 'myUser';

    $user->start();

    // Shows session right after the User object has been started
    print_r($_SESSION);

    // Stores something in the session
    $user->session->myThing = 'my thing goes here';

    // Shows the session with the content of the myThing property
    print_r($_SESSION);

    // Stores something in the PHP session outside of the namespace scope managed by the User class
    $_SESSION['other'] = 'other information stored here';

    print_r($_SESSION);

    // Only destroys the session namespace managed by the User Class
    $user->session->destroy();

    print_r($_SESSION);

?>
```

Here is the output of the previous code:

```
Array
(
    [myUser] => Array
        (
            [data] => Array
                (
                    [Username] => Guess
                    [ID] => 0
                    [Password] => 0
                )

        )
)

Array
(
    [myUser] => Array
        (
            [data] => Array
                (
                    [Username] => Guess
                    [ID] => 0
                    [Password] => 0
                )

            [myThing] => my thing goes here
        )
)

Array
(
    [myUser] => Array
        (
            [data] => Array
                (
                    [Username] => Guess
                    [ID] => 0
                    [Password] => 0
                )

            [myThing] => my thing goes here
        )

    [other] => other information stored here
)

Array
(
    [other] => other information stored here
)

```

The `Session` class can be use for other aspects of your application as well. For example to manage the entire PHP
session you could do so by instantiating the Session class without arguments: `new ptejada\uFlex\Session()`

For more information on the `Session` class refer to the [API Documentation][Session]

## Extending the User class

In PHP you area able extend classes just like in any object oriented programming language. Therefore you could extend
the `User` class functionality by adding your methods or modifications without having to modify the class file itself. You
just have create a new PHP class that extends the `User` class:

```php
<php
	class User extends ptejada\uFlex\User{
		/*
		 * Add your default properties values
		 * such as database connection credentials
		 * user default information
		 * Or cookie preferences
		 */

		/*
		 * Create your own methods
		 */
		function updateAvatar(){}

		function linkOpeniD(){}
	}
?>
```
